# undergrad-code-python
A collection of some of my favorite python coding assignments I had to write for a class called CS 2316, Data Manipulation for Science and Industry, as an undergrad at Tech.

I particularly enjoyed these four projects because they emphasize practicality. In the best case scenario, they can be modified slightly and be used immediately in a professional environment; otherwise, they contain the foundations to which I can build a more rigorous, professional implementation upon.

Here is a summary of the four projects:

BOX PACKER

GUI enables you to pack rectangular objects into a 2D space, like packing boxes into a flat truck. The algorithm either packs largest boxes first or packs smallest boxes first. The GUI then reports how many boxes packed, which boxes packe, which aren't packed, and how much space unfilled. Information about these boxes is passed into program as a CSV file with the format: BOX ID, length (number of rows), width (number of columns).

SALARY CHECKER

Downloads salary data from the internet and compares it to a CSV file. The program handles missing or inconsistent data. For example, salary data may be missing in the HTML code, or people that appear in the CSV file may not appear in the HTML data. The program returns a CSV containing the cross-referenced salary data.

XML Processor

This program lists all of the IBM software that will no longer be supported within the next year, using a website that offers this information in XML format.

Login GUI and SQL

A simple GUI with database support that enables you to create an account, then log into it to place orders on pizza. There is also a window devoted to the purchase statistics.
