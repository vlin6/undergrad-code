# undergrad-code
A collection of some of my favorite coding assignments I had to write for class as an undergraduate.

I particularly enjoyed these four projects because they emphasize practicality. In the best case scenario, they can be modified slightly and be used immediately in a professional environment; otherwise, they contain the foundations to which I can build a more rigorous, professional implementation upon.

Here is a summary of the four projects:

BOX PACKER
GUI enables you to pack rectangular objects into a 2D space, like packing boxes into a flat truck. It considers the dimensions of space you are packing objects into and the list of boxes. The algorithm either packs largest boxes first or packs smallest boxes first. 

The GUI reports how many boxes packed, which boxes packe, which aren't packed, and how much space unfilled. Information about these boxes is passed into program as a CSV file with the format: BOX ID, length (number of rows), width (number of columns)

SALARY CHECKER
Downloads salary data from the internet and compares it to a CSV file. The program handles missing or inconsistent data. For example, salary data may be missing in the HTML code, or people that appear in the CSV file may not appear in the HTML data.
